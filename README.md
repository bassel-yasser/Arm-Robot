# Arm-Robot

## Introduction

In today's world, there is a constant need for additional support systems. With the rapid increase in information flow, people are continually seeking different markets, and competition has driven the need to produce high-quality products at lower costs. To achieve this, automation systems have become essential, as they minimize errors and support the production of quality products by complementing experienced and well-trained employees.

Due to their physical limitations, humans often rely on auxiliary machines in situations where their strength is insufficient. Initially, these machines required human assistance, but technological advancements have enabled them to operate autonomously. One of the most prominent components of automation systems is robots. This project aims to explore and implement knowledge about mechanics and software through the development and operation of a robotic arm designed to execute predetermined tasks.

The robotic arm in this project is controlled via an Android phone or tablet. It can transport materials, mix them, and execute commands set by a user. The primary task of the robotic arm in this project is to pick up a piece of material, move it to a desired position, and repeat the action until instructed to stop. To ensure precise operation and high torque, servomotors are used. The robotic arm consists of four servo motors, enabling movement along four axes.

The project utilizes an Arduino for programming and servo motor control. This setup allows the robotic arm to perform the desired operations using Arduino components without the need for additional circuitry beyond the servo motor inputs.

For the mechanical design, the robot arm is modeled using the SolidWorks program, with specific dimensions. A 6V power supply is used to power the robot.
